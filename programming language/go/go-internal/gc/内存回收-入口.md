# gc



[TOC]

go的gc是通过启动协程来执行的，该协程在runtime 包初始化阶段被启动(init函数)。执行函数forcegchelper

### forcegchelper

runtime/proc.go

forcegchelper 是执行gc的协程

~~~go
func forcegchelper() {
	forcegc.g = getg()
	for {
		lock(&forcegc.lock)
		if forcegc.idle != 0 {
			throw("forcegc: phase error")
		}
		atomic.Store(&forcegc.idle, 1)
		goparkunlock(&forcegc.lock, "force gc (idle)", traceEvGoBlock, 1)
		// this goroutine is explicitly resumed by sysmon
		if debug.gctrace > 0 {
			println("GC forced")
		}
		gcStart(gcBackgroundMode, true)
	}
}

##### gcStart

runtime/mgc.go

~~~go
// gcStart transitions the GC from _GCoff to _GCmark (if mode ==
// gcBackgroundMode) or _GCmarktermination (if mode !=
// gcBackgroundMode) by performing sweep termination and GC
// initialization.

// such as when called on a system stack or with locks held.

	// the guts of a number of libraries that might be holding
	// locks, don't attempt to start GC in non-preemptible or
	// potentially unstable situations.

	//
	// This shouldn't happen if we're being invoked in background
	// mode since proportional sweep should have just finished
	// sweeping everything, but rounding errors, etc, may leave a
	// few spans unswept. In forced mode, this is necessary since
	// GC can be forced at any point in the sweeping cycle.

		// up-pointers).
		//

##### gcBgMarkStartWorkers 启动负责标记的协程

* 为每个不为空的p分配一个协程

~~~go

// These goroutines will not run until the mark phase, but they must
// be started while the work is not stopped and from a regular G
// stack. The caller must hold worldsema.

	// Background marking is performed by per-P G's. Ensure that
	// each P has a background GC G.
