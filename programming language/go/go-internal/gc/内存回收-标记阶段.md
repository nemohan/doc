##### gcWork

~~~go
// A gcWork provides the interface to produce and consume work for the
// garbage collector.
//
// A gcWork can be used on the stack as follows:
//
//     (preemption must be disabled)
//     gcw := &getg().m.p.ptr().gcw
//     .. call gcw.put() to produce and gcw.get() to consume ..
//     if gcBlackenPromptly {
//         gcw.dispose()
//     }
//
// It's important that any use of gcWork during the mark phase prevent
// the garbage collector from transitioning to mark termination since
// gcWork may locally hold GC work buffers. This can be done by
// disabling preemption (systemstack or acquirem).
type gcWork struct {
	// wbuf1 and wbuf2 are the primary and secondary work buffers.
	//
	// This can be thought of as a stack of both work buffers'
	// pointers concatenated. When we pop the last pointer, we
	// shift the stack up by one work buffer by bringing in a new
	// full buffer and discarding an empty one. When we fill both
	// buffers, we shift the stack down by one work buffer by
	// bringing in a new empty buffer and discarding a full one.
	// This way we have one buffer's worth of hysteresis, which
	// amortizes the cost of getting or putting a work buffer over
	// at least one buffer of work and reduces contention on the
	// global work lists.
	//
	// wbuf1 is always the buffer we're currently pushing to and
	// popping from and wbuf2 is the buffer that will be discarded
	// next.
	//
	// Invariant: Both wbuf1 and wbuf2 are nil or neither are.
