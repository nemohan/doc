// gcenable is called after the bulk of the runtime initialization,
// just before we're about to start letting user code run.
// It kicks off the background sweeper goroutine and enables GC.
func gcenable() {
	c := make(chan int, 1)
	go bgsweep(c)
	<-c
	memstats.enablegc = true // now that runtime is initialized, GC is okay
}
