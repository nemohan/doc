# 协程-结束



协程结束时通过调用goexit结束



### goexit

~~~
// goexit is the return stub at the top of every goroutine call stack.
// Each goroutine stack is constructed as if goexit called the
// goroutine's entry point function, so that when the entry point
// function returns, it will return to goexit, which will call goexit1
// to perform the actual exit.
//
// This function must never be called directly. Call goexit1 instead.
// gentraceback assumes that goexit terminates the stack. A direct
// call on the stack will cause gentraceback to stop walking the stack
// prematurely and if there are leftover stack barriers it may panic.
func goexit(neverCallThisFunction)
