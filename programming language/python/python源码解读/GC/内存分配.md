/*
Functions and macros for modules that implement new object types.

- PyObject_New(type, typeobj) allocates memory for a new object of the given
  type, and initializes part of it.  'type' must be the C structure type used
  to represent the object, and 'typeobj' the address of the corresponding
  type object.  Reference count and type pointer are filled in; the rest of
  the bytes of the object are *undefined*!  The resulting expression type is
  'type *'.  The size of the object is determined by the tp_basicsize field
  of the type object.
- PyObject_NewVar(type, typeobj, n) is similar but allocates a variable-size
  object with room for n items.  In addition to the refcount and type pointer
  fields, this also fills in the ob_size field.
- PyObject_Del(op) releases the memory allocated for an object.  It does not
  run a destructor -- it only frees the memory.  PyObject_Free is identical.
- PyObject_Init(op, typeobj) and PyObject_InitVar(op, typeobj, n) don't
  allocate memory.  Instead of a 'type' parameter, they take a pointer to a
  new object (allocated by an arbitrary allocator), and initialize its object
  header fields.

Note that objects created with PyObject_{New, NewVar} are allocated using the
specialized Python allocator (implemented in obmalloc.c), if WITH_PYMALLOC is
enabled.  In addition, a special debugging allocator is used if PYMALLOC_DEBUG
is also #defined.

In case a specific form of memory management is needed (for example, if you
must use the platform malloc heap(s), or shared memory, or C++ local storage or
operator new), you must first allocate the object with your custom allocator,
then pass its pointer to PyObject_{Init, InitVar} for filling in its Python-
specific fields:  reference count, type pointer, possibly others.  You should
be aware that Python no control over these objects because they don't
cooperate with the Python memory manager.  Such objects may not be eligible
for automatic garbage collection and you have to make sure that they are
released accordingly whenever their destructor gets called (cf. the specific
form of memory management you're using).

Unless you have specific memory management requirements, use
PyObject_{New, NewVar, Del}.

/* Functions to call the same malloc/realloc/free as used by Python's
   object allocator.  If WITH_PYMALLOC is enabled, these may differ from
   the platform malloc/realloc/free.  The Python object allocator is
   designed for fast, cache-conscious allocation of many "small" objects,
   and with low hidden memory overhead.

   PyObject_Malloc(0) returns a unique non-NULL pointer if possible.

   PyObject_Realloc(NULL, n) acts like PyObject_Malloc(n).
   PyObject_Realloc(p != NULL, 0) does not return  NULL, or free the memory
   at p.

   Returned pointers must be checked for NULL explicitly; no action is
   performed on failure other than to return NULL (no warning it printed, no
   exception is set, etc).

   For allocating objects, use PyObject_{New, NewVar} instead whenever
   possible.  The PyObject_{Malloc, Realloc, Free} family is exposed
   so that you can exploit Python's small-block allocator for non-object
   uses.  If you must use these routines to allocate object memory, make sure
   the object gets initialized via PyObject_{Init, InitVar} after obtaining
   the raw memory.

   directly in your own extension.  Using PyMem_Free instead ensures Python
   can return the memory to the proper heap.  As another example, in
   PYMALLOC_DEBUG mode, Python wraps all calls to all PyMem_ and PyObject_
   memory functions in special debugging wrappers that add additional
   debugging info to dynamic memory blocks.  The system routines have no idea
   what to do with that stuff, and the Python wrappers have no idea what to do
