# 请求处理

细心的读者会发现在启动之后，调用了handle_request。但在WSGIServer的定义中并没有此函数，我们逆流而上看其定义在哪个父类中。这里我们再次将WSGISever的继承关系列出来:

WSGIServer--->HTTPServer--->TCPServer---->BaseServer

经过一番寻觅，在基类BaseServer中发现了它的身影:

~~~python
def handle_request(self):
        """Handle one request, possibly blocking.

        Respects self.timeout.
        """
        # Support people who used socket.settimeout() to escape
        # handle_request before self.timeout was available.
        timeout = self.socket.gettimeout()
        if timeout is None:
            timeout = self.timeout
        elif self.timeout is not None:
            timeout = min(timeout, self.timeout)
        fd_sets = select.select([self], [], [], timeout)
        if not fd_sets[0]:
            self.handle_timeout()
            return
        self._handle_request_noblock()
        
 def _handle_request_noblock(self):
        """Handle one request, without blocking.

        I assume that select.select has returned that the socket is
        readable before this function was called, so there should be
        no risk of blocking in get_request().
        """
        try:
            request, client_address = self.get_request()
        except socket.error:
            return
        if self.verify_request(request, client_address):
            try:
                self.process_request(request, client_address)
            except:
                self.handle_error(request, client_address)
                self.shutdown_request(request)
                

 def process_request(self, request, client_address):
        """Call finish_request.

        Overridden by ForkingMixIn and ThreadingMixIn.

        """
        self.finish_request(request, client_address)
        self.shutdown_request(request)

        
 def finish_request(self, request, client_address):
        """Finish one request by instantiating RequestHandlerClass."""
        self.RequestHandlerClass(request, client_address, self)
~~~



上面finish_request中的RequestHandlerClass是谁呢，还记得启动一篇中make_server中构造server时传递的handler_class参数么，如果你已经忘了，嗯，没关系，它在下面:

~~~python
def make_server(
    host, port, app, server_class=WSGIServer, handler_class=WSGIRequestHandler
):
    """Create a new WSGI server listening on `host` and `port` for `app`"""
    server = server_class((host, port), handler_class)
    server.set_app(app)
    return server
~~~

可以看到RequestHandlerClass就是simple_server.WSGIRequestHandler：

~~~python
class WSGIRequestHandler(BaseHTTPRequestHandler):

    server_version = "WSGIServer/" + __version__

    def get_environ(self):
        env = self.server.base_environ.copy()
        env['SERVER_PROTOCOL'] = self.request_version
        env['REQUEST_METHOD'] = self.command
        if '?' in self.path:
            path,query = self.path.split('?',1)
        else:
            path,query = self.path,''

        env['PATH_INFO'] = urllib.unquote(path)
        env['QUERY_STRING'] = query

        host = self.address_string()
        if host != self.client_address[0]:
            env['REMOTE_HOST'] = host
        env['REMOTE_ADDR'] = self.client_address[0]

        if self.headers.typeheader is None:
            env['CONTENT_TYPE'] = self.headers.type
        else:
            env['CONTENT_TYPE'] = self.headers.typeheader

        length = self.headers.getheader('content-length')
        if length:
            env['CONTENT_LENGTH'] = length

        for h in self.headers.headers:
            k,v = h.split(':',1)
            k=k.replace('-','_').upper(); v=v.strip()
            if k in env:
                continue                    # skip content length, type,etc.
            if 'HTTP_'+k in env:
                env['HTTP_'+k] += ','+v     # comma-separate multiple headers
            else:
                env['HTTP_'+k] = v
        return env

    def get_stderr(self):
        return sys.stderr

    def handle(self):
        """Handle a single HTTP request"""
        print "+" * 10
        traceback.print_stack()
        self.raw_requestline = self.rfile.readline()
        if not self.parse_request(): # An error code has been sent, just exit
            return

        handler = ServerHandler(
            self.rfile, self.wfile, self.get_stderr(), self.get_environ()
        )
        handler.request_handler = self      # backpointer for logging
        handler.run(self.server.get_app())

它的父类BaseHTTPRequestHandler：

~~~python
class BaseHTTPRequestHandler(SocketServer.StreamRequestHandler):

    """HTTP request handler base class.

    The following explanation of HTTP serves to guide you through the
    code as well as to expose any misunderstandings I may have about
    HTTP (so you don't need to read the code to figure out I'm wrong
    :-).

    HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) is an extensible protocol on
    top of a reliable stream transport (e.g. TCP/IP).  The protocol
    recognizes three parts to a request:

    1. One line identifying the request type and path
    2. An optional set of RFC-822-style headers
    3. An optional data part

    The headers and data are separated by a blank line.

    The first line of the request has the form

    <command> <path> <version>

    where <command> is a (case-sensitive) keyword such as GET or POST,
    <path> is a string containing path information for the request,
    and <version> should be the string "HTTP/1.0" or "HTTP/1.1".
    <path> is encoded using the URL encoding scheme (using %xx to signify
    the ASCII character with hex code xx).

    The specification specifies that lines are separated by CRLF but
    for compatibility with the widest range of clients recommends
    servers also handle LF.  Similarly, whitespace in the request line
    is treated sensibly (allowing multiple spaces between components
    and allowing trailing whitespace).

    Similarly, for output, lines ought to be separated by CRLF pairs
    but most clients grok LF characters just fine.

    If the first line of the request has the form

    <command> <path>

    (i.e. <version> is left out) then this is assumed to be an HTTP
    0.9 request; this form has no optional headers and data part and
    the reply consists of just the data.

    The reply form of the HTTP 1.x protocol again has three parts:

    1. One line giving the response code
    2. An optional set of RFC-822-style headers
    3. The data

    Again, the headers and data are separated by a blank line.

    The response code line has the form

    <version> <responsecode> <responsestring>

    where <version> is the protocol version ("HTTP/1.0" or "HTTP/1.1"),
    <responsecode> is a 3-digit response code indicating success or
    failure of the request, and <responsestring> is an optional
    human-readable string explaining what the response code means.

    This server parses the request and the headers, and then calls a
    function specific to the request type (<command>).  Specifically,
    a request SPAM will be handled by a method do_SPAM().  If no
    such method exists the server sends an error response to the
    client.  If it exists, it is called with no arguments:

    do_SPAM()

    Note that the request name is case sensitive (i.e. SPAM and spam
    are different requests).

    The various request details are stored in instance variables:

    - client_address is the client IP address in the form (host,
    port);

    - command, path and version are the broken-down request line;

    - headers is an instance of mimetools.Message (or a derived
    class) containing the header information;

    - rfile is a file object open for reading positioned at the
    start of the optional input data part;

    - wfile is a file object open for writing.

    IT IS IMPORTANT TO ADHERE TO THE PROTOCOL FOR WRITING!

    The first thing to be written must be the response line.  Then
    follow 0 or more header lines, then a blank line, and then the
    actual data (if any).  The meaning of the header lines depends on
    the command executed by the server; in most cases, when data is
    returned, there should be at least one header line of the form

    Content-type: <type>/<subtype>

    where <type> and <subtype> should be registered MIME types,
    e.g. "text/html" or "text/plain".

WSGIRequestHandler--->BaseHTTPRequestHandler--->StreamRequestHandler--->BaseRequestHandler

经过上面的一系列步骤后，我们找到了WSGIRequesthandler的构造函数来自于太爷爷,也就是BaseRequestHandler。看看太爷爷留下了什么遗产

* 调用setup，WSGIRequestHandler及其父亲都没有定义setup,但其爷爷定义了。ok,调用其爷爷也就是StreamRequestHandler.setup
* 调用handle,调用WSGIRequestHandler.handle
