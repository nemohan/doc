# 队列



Write a class `RecentCounter` to count recent requests.

It has only one method: `ping(int t)`, where t represents some time in milliseconds.

Return the number of `ping`s that have been made from 3000 milliseconds ago until now.

Any ping with time in `[t - 3000, t]` will count, including the current ping.

It is guaranteed that every call to `ping` uses a strictly larger value of `t` than before.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: inputs = ["RecentCounter","ping","ping","ping","ping"], inputs = [[],[1],[100],[3001],[3002]]
Output: [null,1,2,3,3]
```

 

**Note:**

1. Each test case will have at most `10000` calls to `ping`.
2. Each test case will call `ping` with strictly increasing values of `t`.
3. Each call to ping will have `1 <= t <= 10^9`.

##### 算法

~~~go

type RecentCounter struct {

    queue []int
}


func Constructor() RecentCounter {
    return RecentCounter{
    }
}


func (this *RecentCounter) Ping(t int) int {
    this.queue = append(this.queue, t)
    l := t - 3000
    if l < 0{
        l = 0
    }
    n := 0
    for j := len(this.queue)-1; j >= 0; j--{
        if this.queue[j] <=t && this.queue[j] >= l{
            n++
        }
    }
    return n
}
~~~
